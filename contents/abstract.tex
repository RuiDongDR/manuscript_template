\textbf{Background:} Start with 1--2 sentences explaining the broad field and the specific gap your research addresses. Why does this work matter right now?

\textbf{Methods:} Summarize your approach. Mention the custom statistical framework $\by = \bX \bbeta + \bepsilon$ or the specific algorithms used. This highlights the technical rigor of your methodology.

\textbf{Results:} State your most important findings clearly. For example, "We demonstrate that our method achieves a significant reduction in $Z$-score variance as defined in \cref{eq:zscore}." (Note: some journals discourage citations or cross-references in abstracts).

\textbf{Conclusions:} End with the "So what?" sentence. How does this research move the field forward or change how others should approach this problem?
